# mumble-web

mumble-web is an HTML5 [Mumble] client for use in modern browsers.

A live demo is running [here](https://voice.johni0702.de/?address=voice.johni0702.de&port=443/demo) (or [without WebRTC](https://voice.johni0702.de/?address=voice.johni0702.de&port=443/demo&webrtc=false)).

The Mumble protocol uses TCP for control and UDP for voice.
Running in a browser, both are unavailable to this client.
Instead Websockets are used for control and WebRTC is used for voice (using Websockets as fallback if the server does not support WebRTC).

In WebRTC mode (default) only the Opus codec is supported.

In fallback mode, when WebRTC is not supported by the server, only the Opus and CELT Alpha codecs are supported.
This is accomplished with libopus, libcelt (0.7.1) and libsamplerate, compiled to JS via emscripten.
Performance is expected to be less reliable (especially on low-end devices) than in WebRTC mode and loading time will be significantly increased.

Quite a few features, most noticeably all
administrative functionallity, are still missing.

### Installing

#### Download
mumble-web can either be installed directly from npm with `npm install -g mumble-web`
or from git (recommended because the npm version may be out of date):

```
git clone https://github.com/johni0702/mumble-web
cd mumble-web
npm install
```
Note that npm **must not** be ran as the root user (even in a container) because it will try to do special things which cause the build to fail, use a non-root user account instead.

The npm version is prebuilt and ready to use whereas the git version allows you
to e.g. customize the theme before building it.

Either way you will end up with a `dist` folder that contains the static page.

#### Setup
At the time of writing this there do not seem to be any Mumble servers which natively support Websockets+WebRTC.
[Grumble](https://github.com/mumble-voip/grumble) natively supports Websockets and can run mumble-web in fallback mode but not (on its own) in WebRTC mode.
To use this client with any standard mumble server in WebRTC mode, [mumble-web-proxy] must be set up (preferably on the same machine that the Mumble server is running on).

Additionally you will need some web server to serve static files and terminate the secure websocket connection (mumble-web-proxy only supports insecure ones).

Here are two web server configuration files (one for [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) and one for [Caddy server](https://caddyserver.com/)) which will serve the mumble-web interface at `https://voice.example.com` and allow the websocket to connect at `wss://voice.example.com/demo` (similar to the demo server).
Replace `<proxybox>` with the host name of the machine where `mumble-web-proxy` is running. If `mumble-web-proxy` is running on the same machine as your web server, use `localhost`.

* NGINX configuration file
```Nginx
server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name voice.example.com;
        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/voice.example.com/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/voice.example.com/privkey.pem;

        location / {
                root /path/to/dist;
        }
        location /demo {
                proxy_pass http://<proxybox>:64737;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        }
}

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        '' close;
}
```

* Caddy configuration file (`Caddyfile`)
```
http://voice.example.com {
  redir https://voice.example.com
}

https://voice.example.com {
  tls "/etc/letsencrypt/live/voice.example.com/fullchain.pem" "/etc/letsencrypt/live/voice.example.com/privkey.pem"
  root /path/to/dist
  proxy /demo http://<proxybox>:64737 {
    websocket
  }
}
```

To run `mumble-web-proxy`, execute the following command. Replace `<mumbleserver>` with the host name of your Mumble server (the one you connect to using the normal Mumble client).
Note that even if your Mumble server is running on the same machine as your `mumble-web-proxy`, you should use the external name because (by default, for disabling see its README) `mumble-web-proxy` will try to verify the certificate provided by the Mumble server and fail if it does not match the given host name.
```
mumble-web-proxy --listen-ws 64737 --server <mumbleserver>:64738
```
If your mumble-web-proxy is running behind a NAT or firewall, take note of the respective section in its README.

Make sure that your Mumble server is running. You may now open `https://voice.example.com` in a web browser. You will be prompted for server details: choose either `address: voice.example.com/demo` with `port: 443` or `address: voice.example.com` with `port: 443/demo`. You may prefill these values by appending `?address=voice.example.com/demo&port=443`. Choose a username, and click `Connect`: you should now be able to talk and use the chat.

Here is an example of systemd service, put it in `/etc/systemd/system/mumble-web.service` and adapt it to your needs:
```
[Unit]
Description=Mumble web interface
Documentation=https://github.com/johni0702/mumble-web
Requires=network.target mumble-server.service
After=network.target mumble-server.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
ExecStart=/usr/bin/websockify --web=/usr/lib/node_modules/mumble-web/dist --ssl-target localhost:64737 localhost:64738

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start mumble-web
systemctl enable mumble-web
```

### Configuration
The `app/config.js` file contains default values and descriptions for all configuration options.
You can overwrite those by editing the `config.local.js` file within your `dist` folder. Make sure to back up and restore the file whenever you update to a new version.

### Themes
The default theme of mumble-web tries to mimic the excellent [MetroMumble]Light theme.
mumble-web also includes a dark version, named MetroMumbleDark, which is heavily inspired by [MetroMumble]'s dark version.

To select a theme other than the default one, append a `theme=dark` query parameter (where `dark` is the name of the theme) when accessing the mumble-web page.
E.g. [this](https://voice.johni0702.de/?address=voice.johni0702.de&port=443/demo&theme=dark)is the live demo linked above but using the dark theme (`dark` is an alias for `MetroMumbleDark`).

Custom themes can be created by deriving them from the MetroMumbleLight/Dark themes just like the MetroMumbleDark theme is derived from the MetroMumbleLight theme.

### Matrix Widget
mumble-web has specific support for running as a widget in a [Matrix] room.

While just using the URL to a mumble-web instance in a Custom Widget should work for most cases, making full use of all supported features will require some additional trickery. Also note that audio may not be functioning properly on newer Chrome versions without these extra steps.

This assumes you are using the Riot Web or Desktop client. Other clients will probably require different steps.
1. Type `/devtools` into the message box of the room and press Enter
2. Click on `Send Custom Event`
3. Click on `Event` in the bottom right corner (it should change to `State Event`)
4. Enter `im.vector.modular.widgets` for `Event Type`
5. Enter `mumble` for `State Key` (this value may be arbitrary but must be unique per room)
6. For `Event Content` enter (make sure to replace the example values):
```
{
  "waitForIframeLoad": true,
  "name": "Mumble",
  "creatorUserId": "@your_user_id:your_home_server.example",
  "url": "https://voice.johni0702.de/?address=voice.johni0702.de&port=443/mumble&matrix=true&username=$matrix_display_name&theme=$theme&avatarurl=$matrix_avatar_url",
  "data": {},
  "type": "customwidget",
  "id": "mumble"
}
```
The `$var` parts of the `url` are intentional and will be replaced by Riot whenever a widget is loaded (i.e. they will be different for every user). The `username` query parameter sets the default username to the user's Matrix display name, the `theme` parameter automatically uses the dark theme if it's used in Riot, and the `avatarurl` will automatically download the user's avatar on Matrix and upload it as the avatar in Mumble.
Finally, the `matrix=true` query parameter replaces the whole `Connect to Server` dialog with a single `Join Conference` button, so make sure to remove it if you do not supply default values for all connection parameters as above.
The `type` needs to be `jitsi` to allow the widget to use audio and to stay open when switching to a different room (this will hopefully change once Riot is able to ask for permission from the user by itself).
The `id` should be the same as the `State Key` from step 5.
See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uPF7XWY_dXTKVKV7jZQ2KmsI19wn9-kFRgQ1tFQP7wQ/edit) for more information on the values of these fields.
